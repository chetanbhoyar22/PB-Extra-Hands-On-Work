    <p>In our Javascript we are having three types of variables - <br/><br/>
        <strong>1. var</strong><br/>
        var is a Global or Functional Scoped. <br/>
        var can be reassigned. <br/>
        var can be redeclare. <br/>
        var can be modified later.<br/><br/>

        <strong>2. let</strong><br/>
        let  is a Block  Scoped. <br/>
        let cannot be reassigned. <br/> 
        let cannot be redeclare.  <br/>
        let can be modified later.<br/><br/>

        <strong>3. const</strong><br/>
        const is a Block  Scoped. <br/>
        const cannot be reassigned. <br/>
        const cannot be redeclare. <br/>
        const cannot be modified later. </p>


    <br><strong>Hoisting -</strong> Hoisting is a default Javascript Mechanism where our variables and Functions declarations are moved to top of their Scope before code execution (),only declarations are hoisted not initializations.<br/></br>

    <strong>Dead Zone -</strong> The time between the Variables hosted and the variables get initialized is called the Temporal Dead Zone<br/>
    Let and const are also hoisted and are in Temporal Dead Zone</p><br>

    <strong>Note - Example are executed in js file.</strong>
